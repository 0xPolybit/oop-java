# Day 3: Inheritance

## [Question 1](./Manufacture.java)

A Plastic manufacturer sells plastic in different shapes like 2D sheet and 3D box. The cost of sheet is Rs 40/ per square ft. and the cost of box is Rs 60/ per cubic ft. Implement it in Java to calculate the cost of plastic as per the dimensions given by the user where 3D inherits from 2D.

**Input:** `Enter dimensions (length, breadth, height)`

**Output:** `Display the cost of manufacturing`

## [Question 2](./Dimensions.java)

Illustrate the execution of constructors in multi-level inheritance with three Java classes – Plate(length, width), Box(length, width, height), WoodBox(length, width, height, thickness) where Box inherits from Plate and WoodBox inherits from Box class. Each class has constructor where dimensions are taken from user.

**Input:** `Enter the dimensions (length, width, height, thickness)`

**Output:** `Display the dimensions for the created WoodBox object`

## [Question 3](./Account.java)

Write a class Account containing acc_no, balance as data members and two methods as input() for taking input from user and disp() method to display the details. Create a subclass Person which has name and aadhar_no as extra data members and override disp() function. Write the complete program to take and print details of three persons.

**Input:** `Enter details of three persons (Account Number, Balance, Name, Aadhar Number)`

**Output:** `Display details of all three persons`
