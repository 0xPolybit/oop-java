# Day 2: Java Programming Basics

## [Question 1](./EvenOddCounter.java)

Accept 10 numbers from command line and check how many of them are even and how many are odd.

**Input:** `Enter 10 number from keyboard`

**Output:** `Display number of even and odd number`

## [Question 2](./ObjectCounter.java)

Program to find no. of objects created out of a class using ‘static’ modifier.

**Input:** ``No of objects created`

**Output:** `Display the number of objects created (e.g. no of objects=3)`

## [Question 3](./Demo.java)

Write a class file – box with three data members(length, width, height) and a method volume(). Also implement the application class Demo where an object of the box class is created with user entered dimensions and volume is printed.

**Input:** `length, width, height`

**Output:** `Volume`

## [Question 4](./Rectangle.java)

Write a program in Java to create a class Rectangle having data members length and breadth and three methods called read, calculate and display to read the values of length and breadth, calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle and display the result respectively.

**Input:** `Mention length and breadth`

**Output:** `Display Area of Rectangle and Perimeter of rectangle`

## [Question 5](./StudentList.java)

Write a program in java to input and display the details of n number of students having roll, name and cgpa as data members. Also display the name of the student having lowest cgpa.

**Input:** `Enter Roll No, Name and cgpa of ‘n’ number of students`

**Output:** `Display the details of ‘n’ number of students. Also display the name of student with lowest cgpa`

## [Question 6](./SubtractOverload.java)

Write a program to overload subtract method with various parameters in a class in Java. Write the driver class to use the different subtract methods using object.

**Input:** `Mention various subtract method having different parameters`

**Output:** `Subtract method will display the result accordingly`

## [Question 7](./RectangleAreaOverload.java)

Write a program in java using constructor overloading concept to calculate the area of a rectangle having data member as length and breadth. Use default constructor to initialize the value of the data member to zero and parameterized constructor to initialize the value of data member according to the user input.

**Input:** `Mention the value of length and breadth`

**Output:** `Display the area of rectangle accordingly`
